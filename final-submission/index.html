    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has revealed major technical and social
    issues with modern methods of collecting public health data. National
    COVID-19 case surveillance currently uses an exceptionally expensive data
    supply chain involving multiple hospitals, healthcare providers, and
    laboratories. Data from these sources must then be channeled through several
    layers of legal approval, processed, and eventually sent to the Centers for
    Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for epidemiological analysis.1 This
    process is not only slow, but also poses concerns for data privacy, as the
    identifiability of data is reliant on there being no bad actors in the
    pipeline. Moreover, it results in an underreporting problem, as citizens
    have no strong incentives for providing their data to the supply chain.2
    This project proposes a program called Pathogen on the Solana blockchain,
    with the purpose of using blockchain protocols to solve issues with
    traditional public health data collection. Pathogen solves data privacy
    vulnerabilities by using unidentifiable Solana accounts to store diagnostic
    data, and also provides incentive for users to submit data via
    cryptocurrency rewards. Furthermore, the fast transaction speeds of the
    Solana blockchain makes collected profiles quickly accessible, meaning that
    both large corporations and independent researchers have the ability to view
    and analyze the data as soon as possible. The deliverables of this project
    include two primary components: a proof-of-concept program written using the
    Anchor framework, and a design for a more complex version of Pathogen for
    use in the real world (referred to as the Pathogen Plan). The Pathogen
    proof-of-concept uses native Solana (SOL) as a reward for submitting health
    data, whereas the Pathogen Plan proposes a much more sophisticated Solana
    Program Library token (SPL-token). The Pathogen proof-of-concept is
    currently deployed on the Solana DevNet and accessible at
    <a href="https://pathogen.jasonwu.io/">https://pathogen.jasonwu.io/</a>.
    Users can interact with the program directly using a Phantom wallet
    connected to the Solana DevNet:
